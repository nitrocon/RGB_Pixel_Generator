# RGB Pixel Generator

A Python tool for generating Images with adjustable pixelsize in RGB, optimized for CUDA and parallel processing.
I use this tool to train several AI models.

## üìã Installation

Run autostart_script.bat (autoinstall) or
follow these steps to set up the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nitrocon/RGB_Pixel_Generator.git
cd RGB_Pixel_Generator
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
python generator.py
```

## üõ† Features

- Generating Images with an adjustable pixelsize
- Efficient Image Generation: Utilizes CUDA for faster pixel computation. (Due to compatibility issues its not working)
- Dynamic Memory Adjustment: Automatically adapts batch size based on available memory.
- User-Friendly GUI: Provides an intuitive interface for configuring and monitoring the process.
- Scalable Processing: Supports both CPU and GPU for optimal performance.

## üìÑ Usage

1. Run the `generator.py` script.
2. Use the GUI to set parameters such as image size, color range, and output directory.
3. Start the generation process and monitor progress via the GUI.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `torch` library (for CUDA support)
- `psutil` library (for memory management)
- `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) for image generation
- Tkinter (for GUI)
